## 👨‍💻 Michael Thompson – Senior Penetration Tester at SentinelForge Security

I lead offensive security assessments that simulate real-world attacks to help organizations fix vulnerabilities *before* they’re exploited. From web apps and mobile endpoints to physical access tests — I’ve breached it all (ethically, of course).

### 🛠️ Expertise:
- **Web/Mobile App Security**
- **Physical Red Teaming**
- **Infrastructure & Internal Network Assessments**
- **Post-Exploitation & Pivoting**
- **Mentoring Junior Red Teamers**

I’ve helped secure organizations across **finance**, **healthcare**, and **logistics**, and regularly train newer team members on:
- Engagement planning & scoping
- Initial access & privilege escalation
- Reporting that actually helps dev teams

### 🐾 Personal Bits:
- 🎂 Born: **January 20, 1977**
- 🐱 Cat: **Luna**, our accidental keyboard attacker
- 👨‍👧‍👧👦 Proud father of three amazing kids
- 🎮 Weekends = patching Minecraft servers & dodging creepers IRL

> I break into systems at work and keep them patched at home.  
> Red teamer by trade, dad by nature.
